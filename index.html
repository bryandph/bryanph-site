    <h2>Why should I care?</h2>

    <h2>So what can he do for me?</h2>

    <p>
      He can do pentesting, policy analysis, and vulnerability assessment. He also has experience designing A/V solutions and administrating enterprise systems. None of that would be any good if he couldn't fix the problems he discovers or designs, so he can also program in a wide variety of contexts from web development to embeded software and hardware.
