# That feeling where everything's fine, yet it's totally not

Lately I have been feeling lonely as shit. I have good supportive friends for sure, and career-wise I'm on my way to being able to do interesting and useful things. The isolation is real when those people arn't there for you the way you need and your job can't distract you from the deep sense of dread filling your soul. I try to find hobby projects to work on; to fill time so I don't sit there and let the nihilism catch up with me. These are good things, but they don't replace the social interaction I lack. My job is filled with non-disclosure clauses, so barring everything but the tools I work with, most of my livelihood is off limits to sharing. I'm the soul engineer there on a daily basis, and not being able to discuss my work with anyone sucks. Not to say I haven't tried to engage people in discussion, but they always, *always*, stop responding or give me canned, shitty responses and change the subject. The only time people contact me first is when they need help or advice on a problem they have. Now-a-days the greatest rush I can get is the satisfaction of knowing that I solved someone else's problem. I wish, that just once someone would try to have an conversation with me but initiate it themselves, just for the sake of talking.
