        <title>Why I'm Struggling</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;that-feeling-where-everythings-fine-yet-its-totally-not&quot;&gt;That Feeling Where Everything’s Fine, Yet It’s Totally Not&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been very depressed recently. I feel lonely and yet I’m surrounded by people. I go through the same routine everyday: wake up, go to class, go to work, and go home. The one thing that never fits in is social interaction. I’m too anxious to be able to cold approach people and strike up discussion. Even on social media I find it hard to initiate conversations. The only people who &lt;strong&gt;ever&lt;/strong&gt; initiate contact with me are those who want advice or need me to help them with something, and I follow through all the time. It’s the one small glimmer of joy that I get; when I see a problem someone has and I can help them solve it. No one ever initiates a conversation just to check in or chat, and frankly I think I may have lost the ability to have those sort of conversations due to disuse. I have tried to talk to people, but somehow I always seem to fuck it all up. I overthink things and get needy. Tonight I am all alone in my apartment, and all I want is a friend to talk to. The feeling of isolation is scary to me. I don’t like feeling alone, but the longer time goes on the more I fear that emotion will become a permanent part of my personality. I’m reminded of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/70534716&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; which describes this situation perfectly, but because of my own social anxiety I am still struggling to get out and have those real conversations. I think it is important that I figure out how to make real life friendships and connections that actually last, otherwise I don’t this this struggle will lessen it’s effect on my happiness or livelihood.&lt;/p&gt;
